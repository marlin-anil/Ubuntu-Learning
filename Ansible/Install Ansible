- Install the required package before install ansible
  ```
  # Updates the list of available software packages from Ubuntu repositories.
  sudo apt update
  # After that, must be to fill the username and the password of the account who had subscription RHEL
  sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
  # Adds the official Ansible PPA repository and install the latest version of Ansible.
  sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
  ```

#### For network configuration i prefer to use nmtui (NetworkManager UI) to set set network configuration
```
# user user root for administartor access, or u can use sudo for privillage access
sudo nmtui
# restart and apply
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```
